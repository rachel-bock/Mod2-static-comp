### Introduction

![Static-Comp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70186075/170852808-ad23a739-df70-40e3-a2d6-3473938a6b7d.png)

The point of this project is to practice matching a comp.  The primary focus was on HTML and CSS.  No JavaScript was involved.

### Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- Visual Studio Code

### Set Up
1.  Clone this [repository](https://github.com/rachel-bock/Mod2-static-comp).
2. `cd` into the directory.
3. Run `open index.html`.

### Deployment Link
- Simply go to: https://rachel-bock.github.io/Mod2-static-comp/

### Wins
- The cards appear in a grid format with 4 cards per row.
- The images on the cards match the card size when the page size is changed.
- The icons and words in the navigation bar are aligned so the center of the words are centered compared to the icons.

### Challenges
- The primary focus was practicing HTML and CSS.  As such, the bigget challenge was getting the CSS to manipulate the elements appropriately.
- I wanted to update website design for screen reader accessibility.
- I also wanted to implement responsive design for tablet and mobile devices.
